## üîç Use Case

Relationship Managers often spend hours manually entering meeting notes and customer engagement data into CRM systems. RM Copilot simplifies this process.

With RM Copilot, the RM simply:

1. Opens the app on their mobile device.
2. Taps to dictate a summary of the customer interaction.
3. Speaks naturally, describing:
   - Who they met with
   - Topics discussed
   - Any required follow-up actions or CRM updates

The AI-powered backend then analyzes the input and automatically:

- Captures new **leads**, **opportunities**, **complaints**, or **service requests**
- Links all records to a new **Call Report** in **Dynamics 365 CRM**
- Allows the RM to **review and confirm** the data before saving
